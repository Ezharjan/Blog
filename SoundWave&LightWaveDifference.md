# Difference of A Sound Wave and A Light Wave

1. **Nature**: Light waves are electromagnetic waves (non-mechanical, so the light wave does not require a physical medium in order to propagate), whereas sound waves are mechanical waves and always require a medium such as air, water, or solids.
2. **Speed**: Light waves travel at an extremely high speed of approximately 299,792 km/s in a vacuum. Sound waves, in comparison, travel at a much slower speed, typically around 343 m/s in air.
3. **Sensory Perception**: Light waves are detected by our eyes and enable us to perceive visual information, including colors, shapes, and brightness. Sound waves, on the other hand, are detected by our ears and allow us to perceive auditory information, including pitch, volume, and timbre.
4. **Wavelength and Frequency**: Light waves have much smaller wavelengths (ranging from nanometers to micrometers) and higher frequencies (ranging from hundreds of terahertz to hundreds of petahertz) compared to sound waves. Sound waves have larger wavelengths (ranging from centimeters to meters) and lower frequencies (ranging from a few hertz to tens of kilohertz).
5. **Interactions**: Light waves can be reflected, refracted, diffracted, and polarized. They can also undergo interference and exhibit properties like interference patterns. Sound waves, on the other hand, can be reflected, refracted, and diffracted, but they do not undergo polarization or exhibit interference patterns in the same way as light waves.
6. **Vibration of the Wave**: Vibrations in light waves are perpendicular to the direction along which the light travels while vibrations of the particles in sound waves are in the same direction as that along which the sound travels. A Sound wave is regarded as [Longitudinal Waves](https://byjus.com/physics/longitudinal-waves/) while light waves are referred to as [Transverse Waves](http://science8sc.weebly.com/transverse-waves.html).
