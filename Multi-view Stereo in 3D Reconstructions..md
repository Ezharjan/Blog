# Multi-view stereo in 3D Reconstructions.

## What is multi-view stereo in 3D Reconstructions?

Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a technique used in 3D reconstructions that involves taking multiple images of an object or scene from different viewpoints and using algorithms to create a 3D model from those images. The technique works by identifying common features in the images, such as corners or edges, and using those features to calculate the relative positioning of the cameras and the geometry of the object or scene.

MVS can be used in a variety of applications, such as creating 3D models of buildings, landscapes, or archaeological sites. It is especially useful in cases where traditional methods of surveying or scanning are not feasible or practical, such as in remote or hard-to-reach locations. However, MVS can be computationally intensive and requires specialized software and hardware to process large datasets.

The fusion of different techniques can also help overcome the limitations of individual techniques and produce more robust and reliable results.

## Is there any technics like 'occupancy'  or 'NeRF'?

Yes, there are some techniques like 'Occupancy' and 'NeRF' that have been recently developed for 3D reconstruction.

'Occupancy Networks' is a deep learning-based technique that predicts the occupancy of a 3D grid using a neural network. This technique is based on the idea that each point in space can be either empty or occupied by an object. By predicting the occupancy of each point, the technique creates a 3D model of the object or scene.

'NeRF' (Neural Radiance Fields) is a technique that uses a neural network to model the radiance field of a 3D scene. This technique is based on the idea that light travels through the scene, and a model of the radiance field can be used to render images of the scene from any viewpoint. Unlike other techniques that produce a surface mesh or voxel-based representation of the scene, 'NeRF' produces a continuous representation that can be used to create high-quality images and animations.

Both 'Occupancy Networks' and 'NeRF' are relatively new and have shown promising results in generating high-quality 3D models. However, they require significant computational resources and are currently limited to small-scale scenes or objects.

## What is 'Hand-craft methods' for 3D reconstructions?

'Hand-craft methods' refer to the traditional techniques that are used for 3D reconstructions and are based on explicit algorithms and mathematical models. These techniques are usually labor-intensive and involve a significant amount of manual labor and expertise. Some examples of hand-craft methods for 3D reconstructions are:

1. Photogrammetry: This technique involves taking multiple photographs of an object or scene from different angles and using specialized software to create a 3D model. The software matches corresponding points in the photographs and calculates the 3D coordinates of each point to create a point cloud or a mesh structure.

2. Laser scanning: This technique involves using a laser scanner to capture the geometry and texture of an object or scene. The laser scanner emits a laser beam that reflects off the object or scene and records the time it takes for the light to return. The data collected by the scanner is used to generate a 3D point cloud or a mesh structure.

3. Structured light scanning: This technique involves projecting a pattern of light onto an object or scene and using specialized software to calculate the 3D coordinates of each point based on the distortion of the projected pattern. The data collected by the scanner is used to generate a 3D point cloud or a mesh structure.

Hand-craft methods have been used for 3D reconstructions for many decades and have proven to be effective in generating high-quality 3D models. However, these methods require significant expertise and can be time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of new technologies and machine learning techniques, there has been a shift towards more automated and data-driven approaches for 3D reconstructions in recent years.

## What is 'Deep Learning Methods' for 3D reconstruction?

'Deep Learning Methods' refer to the use of deep neural networks for 3D reconstruction. Deep neural networks are powerful machine learning algorithms that can extract features and patterns from large amounts of data. These methods have been applied to 3D reconstruction and have shown promising results. Some examples of deep learning methods for 3D reconstruction are:

1. PointNet: This method uses a deep neural network to directly process a point cloud and output a reconstructed 3D model. The network is trained to learn features of the point cloud such as local geometry and global structures from a large dataset of 3D models.

2. ShapeNet: This method uses a deep neural network to learn a probabilistic generative model of 3D shapes. The network can generate new 3D shapes that conform to the learned model from a low-dimensional random vector.

3. Voxels: This method uses a deep neural network to fill a 3D voxel grid with values that represent the occupancy or appearance of the scene. The network is trained on large datasets of 3D models and can generate new models by sampling the voxel grids.

Deep learning methods for 3D reconstruction have several benefits over hand-craft methods. They can learn patterns and features from large datasets of 3D models automatically, requiring minimal manual input. They can also be used to generate new 3D models that conform to the learned model. However, deep learning methods also require large amounts of training data and significant computational resources.

## What can DNN provide  for 3D reconstruction?

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can provide several benefits for 3D reconstruction, such as:

1. Automation: DNNs can automate the 3D reconstruction process by learning features and patterns from large datasets of 3D models. This reduces the need for manual input and makes the process faster and more efficient.

2. Accuracy: DNNs can achieve high levels of accuracy in 3D reconstruction by learning to recognize and extract subtle details and patterns from 3D data. This leads to more accurate and detailed 3D models.

3. Flexibility: DNNs can be trained on different types of 3D data, including point clouds, meshes, and voxel grids. This makes them flexible and adaptable to different types of 3D reconstruction tasks.

4. Novelty: DNNs have the potential to generate novel 3D models that conform to the learned model, by generating new samples from the learned distribution. This allows for the exploration of new and diverse 3D models.

5. Speed: DNNs can reconstruct 3D models in real-time or near real-time, making them suitable for real-time applications such as robotics, virtual and augmented reality.

Overall, DNNs can revolutionize 3D reconstruction by making it faster, more efficient, and more accurate. These benefits can enable the development of new and innovative applications that would have been impossible with hand-crafted methods.

## What is 'MVSNet'?

'MVSNet' stands for Multi-View Stereo Network, which is a deep learning method for dense 3D reconstruction from a set of images. MVSNet was introduced in a paper published in 2018 by Yang et al.

MVSNet uses a deep convolutional neural network to predict a dense 3D reconstruction from a set of input images. The network takes as input a set of rectified images and outputs a dense point cloud with per-point confidence scores. MVSNet uses a patch-based approach, where the network predicts per-patch depth values that are then integrated into a dense point cloud.

The primary advantage of MVSNet is that it can produce accurate and robust 3D reconstructions from a set of images without relying on 3D priors or camera calibration. MVSNet can handle a wide range of image configurations, such as varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, and texture complexity. MVSNet has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

MVSNet has several potential applications, including robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and 3D scanning.

## What are te differences between 'MVSNet' and 'DNN' for 3D reconstruction?

MVSNet and DNN for 3D reconstruction are similar in that they both use deep learning techniques to produce accurate 3D reconstructions. However, there are some key differences between them:

1. Input source: MVSNet takes a set of input images as its input source, while DNNs can take various input sources such as images, video, point clouds, or voxel grids.

2. Approach: MVSNet uses a patch-based approach to predict per-patch depth values, which it then integrates into a dense point cloud. DNNs for 3D reconstruction can use a variety of approaches, such as voxel-based or point-based methods, to produce 3D models.

3. Complexity: MVSNet is a specific implementation of a convolutional neural network designed for multi-view stereo reconstruction. DNNs for 3D reconstruction can be more complex, with various architectures and configurations depending on the specific use case and input data.

4. Performance: MVSNet has shown state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency in multi-view stereo reconstruction. DNNs for 3D reconstruction have varying levels of performance depending on the architecture and training data used.

In summary, MVSNet is a specific implementation of a deep learning method for multi-view stereo reconstruction, while DNNs for 3D reconstruction can use various approaches and architectures to produce 3D models from different input sources.

## What is 'Homography'?

Homography is a mathematical transformation that maps points in one image to corresponding points in another image in a projective space. In simpler terms, it is a mapping between two different images taken of the same scene or object, accounting for differences in camera orientation, viewing angles, and distance from the object.

In computer vision and image processing, homography is used to perform tasks such as image registration, object recognition, and image stitching. For example, homography can be used to align two images of the same scene taken from different viewpoints, such as in panoramic image stitching. Homography can also be used to track the motion of an object in a video sequence or to estimate the pose of a camera.

Homography is typically represented as a 3x3 matrix, which can be computed using techniques such as direct linear transformation (DLT) or the normalized eight-point algorithm. Once the homography matrix is calculated, it can be used to transform points from one image to another, allowing for tasks such as image registration or object recognition.

## What is the limitation of 'Homography' for 3D reconstruction tasks using MVSNet?

Homography has some limitations when it comes to 3D reconstruction tasks using MVSNet. The primary limitation is that homography can only handle planar scenes or objects. In other words, if the objects or scenes being reconstructed are not flat, homography cannot capture the 3D information accurately. 

MVSNet is typically used for multi-view stereo reconstruction, in which multiple views of a scene or object are used to generate a 3D model. For non-planar objects or scenes, homography alone cannot provide sufficient information to accurately generate a 3D model. Instead, more complex approaches such as depth estimation or structure-from-motion techniques are required.

Additionally, homography is sensitive to image noise and may produce inaccurate results when there are significant variations in lighting, texture, or camera distortion. Therefore, it is important to pre-process the input images to remove noise or artifacts before applying homography for 3D reconstruction tasks using MVSNet.

In summary, the main limitation of homography for 3D reconstruction tasks using MVSNet is its inability to handle non-planar objects or scenes accurately. Multiple-view depth estimation techniques and structure-from-motion methods are more appropriate for such scenarios.

## What is Differentiable Homography Wraping?

Differentiable homography warping is a technique for differentiably warping one image onto another using homography. It can be used for various computer vision tasks, such as image synthesis, image registration, and video stabilization, among others.

The basic idea behind differentiable homography warping is to use a differentiable transformation function that maps each pixel in the source image to a corresponding pixel in the target image using homography. This function can be used to generate a differentiable loss that measures the difference between the warped source image and the target image, which can be used to train a deep model for various computer vision tasks.

Differentiable homography warping has several advantages over traditional homography warping. First, it allows for the end-to-end training of deep models for various computer vision tasks. Second, it can handle non-rigid transformations, such as affine transformations, perspective transformations, or even more complex deformations. Finally, it can handle occlusions or disocclusions in the source and target images, which are prevalent in many real-world computer vision applications.

Differentiable homography warping is typically implemented as a layer in deep neural networks, where the homography parameters are estimated using a separate network, such as a geometric matching network or a regression network, which is trained end-to-end along with the main network.

## When is Differentiable Homography Wraping first proposed?

Differentiable homography warping was first proposed in the paper "Unsupervised Learning of Depth and Ego-Motion from Video" by Zhou et al. in 2017. In this paper, the authors introduced a deep learning-based approach for unsupervised monocular depth and camera motion estimation from video sequences. 

The proposed approach used a differentiable homography warping layer to generate a reconstruction loss that measured the difference between the warped current image and the previous image in the video sequence. The homography transformation parameters were estimated using a separate network that was trained end-to-end with the main depth and motion estimation network.

Since then, differentiable homography warping has been used in various computer vision tasks, such as image synthesis, image registration, and video stabilization, among others. It has become a popular technique in the computer vision community due to its ability to handle non-rigid transformations and occlusions, and its suitability for end-to-end training with deep neural networks.

## What are the limitations and drawbacks of 'Differentiable Homography Wraping' in reconstructing 3D objects or scenes?

While differentiable homography warping is a powerful technique for various computer vision tasks, including 3D reconstruction, there are some limitations and drawbacks to its use:

1. Limited to Planar Surfaces: One major limitation of homography is that it assumes planar surfaces. This means that it is only suitable for reconstructing scenes or objects that have planar surfaces. If the scene or object contains non-planar surfaces, the results may not be accurate.

2. Limited to Small Motions: Differentiable homography warping assumes that the motion between the source and target images is small. If the motion is too large, the homography transformation may become invalid, leading to inaccurate results.

3. Requires Accurate Camera Calibration: Differentiable homography warping requires accurate camera calibration to estimate the homography transformation parameters. If the camera calibration is not done correctly, the results may not be accurate.

4. Complexity: Differentiable homography warping is a complex technique that involves estimating homography transformation parameters using a separate network, which is trained end-to-end along with the main network. This requires a large amount of computational resources and may not be feasible for some applications.

5. Limited to RGB Images: Differentiable homography warping is typically applied to RGB images. It is not well-suited for reconstructing scenes or objects from other modalities such as depth images or point clouds.

Despite these limitations, differentiable homography warping remains a powerful technique for various computer vision tasks, and its continued development and refinement are likely to expand its applicability in the future.

## What do you mean by 'planar surfaces'?

In geometry, a planar surface is a flat, two-dimensional surface that can be represented as a plane. Planar surfaces are flat, meaning they remain coplanar or remain in the same planar orientation. Examples of planar surfaces include the faces of a cube, the surface of a table or floor, or the wall of a building. 

In the context of computer vision, planar surfaces are important because they are suitable for homography transformations. A homography transformation is a 3x3 matrix that can be used to project a plane in 3D space onto a plane in the image plane. This is useful for various computer vision tasks such as image stitching, panorama creation, and 3D reconstruction of planar scenes.

However, if the scene or object being reconstructed contains non-planar surfaces, it may not be accurately reconstructed using homography. Non-planar surfaces have a more complex 3D structure, and higher order transformations such as affine or projective transformations are needed to accurately transform them. This can make the reconstruction process more challenging and computationally expensive.

## Give me some examples about non-planar surfaces?

Sure, here are some examples of non-planar surfaces:

1. Spherical surfaces: A sphere is a classic example of a non-planar surface. Spherical surfaces have a curved geometry, and standard 3x3 homography transformations are not sufficient to accurately represent transformations on these surfaces.

2. Cylindrical surfaces: Cylindrical surfaces, such as those found in pipes or cans, are also non-planar surfaces. They have a curved geometry along their length, but can be relatively flat along their ends.

3. Free-form surfaces: Free-form surfaces are those that do not have a standard geometric shape, and are instead designed with complex curves and shapes. Examples could include a car's bodywork or a sculpture.

4. Deformed (warped) planar surfaces: Planar surfaces that have been deformed or warped due to physical forces, such as a crumpled piece of paper, are technically still planar, but their surface geometry is no longer simple and flat.

5. Biological surfaces: Surfaces found in nature, such as tree trunks or seashells, often have complex, non-planar 3D structures that cannot be accurately represented using standard planar 3x3 homography transformations. 

 Non-planar surfaces require more advanced techniques, such as 3D reconstruction through stereo imaging or structure from motion, to accurately reconstruct their 3D geometry.

## What are the solutions to overcom the limitations and drawbacks of Homography in 3D reconstructing?

There are several solutions to overcome the limitations and drawbacks of using homography in 3D reconstruction of non-planar surfaces:

1. Stereoscopic Reconstruction: This involves capturing multiple images of the same scene or object from different angles and using them to create a 3D model through triangulation. Stereoscopy can create dense point clouds that accurately represent the 3D geometry of non-planar surfaces. 

2. Structure from Motion (SfM): This is a technique that leverages multiple images of a scene or object, taken from different viewpoints, to infer the 3D structure of the scene or object. SfM can be used to accurately reconstruct complex 3D surfaces and structures.

3. Multi-view Stereo (MVS): This technique involves capturing multiple images of a scene or object from different angles and using them to generate a detailed 3D model by matching corresponding features across the images.

4. Lidar: LIDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging. It is a remote sensing technology that uses laser light to measure the distance between a sensor and the surface of an object. Lidar can be used to accurately capture the 3D geometry of complex non-planar surfaces, such as mountains or forests.

5. Photometric Stereo: This technique uses multiple images taken under different lighting conditions to reconstruct the 3D geometry of an object. It can create accurate models of small, non-planar surfaces with high resolution.

These techniques can be used in combination or separately depending on the specific application and the constraints of the problem.
