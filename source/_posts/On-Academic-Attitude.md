As time passes by from when I started to dig into academia, I've met lots of nice researchers who have serious disciplines on themselves, while also meeting some researchers who are conducting research only for publishing it and obtain the degree they wanted, let alone their "reproducible accomplishments".

How should we view those researchers who "do not want others to reproduce their results published"?
How should we view those researchers who "accidentally omit some important details for reproduction"?
How should we view those researchers who "mistakenly wrote the wrong version of their reproduction environment"?
