  abstract      = "Scene simulation in autonomous driving has gained
                   significant attention because of its huge potential for
                   generating customized data. However, existing editable scene
                   simulation approaches face limitations in terms of user
                   interaction efficiency, multi-camera photo-realistic
                   rendering and external digital assets integration. To
                   address these challenges, this paper introduces ChatSim, the
                   first system that enables editable photo-realistic 3D
                   driving scene simulations via natural language commands with
                   external digital assets. To enable editing with high command
                   flexibility,~ChatSim leverages a large language model (LLM)
                   agent collaboration framework. To generate photo-realistic
                   outcomes, ChatSim employs a novel multi-camera neural
                   radiance field method. Furthermore, to unleash the potential
                   of extensive high-quality digital assets, ChatSim employs a
                   novel multi-camera lighting estimation method to achieve
                   scene-consistent assets' rendering. Our experiments on Waymo
                   Open Dataset demonstrate that ChatSim can handle complex
                   language commands and generate corresponding photo-realistic
                   scene videos.",

  abstract  = "AbstractAutomated driving functions are among the most critical
               software components to develop. Before deployment in series
               vehicles, it has to be shown that the functions drive safely and
               in compliance with traffic rules. Despite the coverage that can
               be reached with very large amounts of test drives, corner cases
               remain possible. Furthermore, the development is subject to
               time-to-delivery constraints due to the highly competitive
               market, and potential logical errors must be found as early as
               possible. We describe an approach to improve the development of
               an actual industrial behavior planner for the Automated Driving
               Alliance between Bosch and Cariad. The original process
               landscape for verification and validation is extended with model
               checking techniques. The idea is to integrate automated
               extraction mechanisms that, starting from the C++ code of the
               planner, generate a higher-level model of the underlying logic.
               This model, composed in closed loop with expressive environment
               descriptions, can be exhaustively analyzed with model checking.
               This results, in case of violations, in traces that can be
               re-executed in system simulators to guide the search for errors.
               The approach was exemplarily deployed in series development, and
               successfully found relevant issues in intermediate versions of
               the planner at development time.",
