# Dynamics of Buoyant Object in Moving Vehicles/Elevators

1. In principle, the **drone**, which is **not supported by the air inside the bus/elevator**, should stay floating in the middle of the bus/elevator while the bus/elevator moves. But due to the **inertia** of the drone, it will move in the opposite direction of the bus/elevator's motion. Because the motion of an elevator/bus is not stable, as it has its own **floating acceleration at different moments**, the **drone will be seen moving in the opposite direction all the time while the bus/elevator moves** (Note that the acceleration is pretty hoard to be exactly 0 on all the directions at a moment either on a vehicle or an elevator). This is also the reason why the ball will not shoot to the end of a plane when you throw it while the plane is moving with 0 acceleration.
2. When it comes to a balloon, since it is **supported by the air inside the bus/elevator**, besides its slight inertia, it is also **more controlled by the air** that remains stationary inside the bus/elevator. So it will be seen **moving in the same direction as the bus/elevator all the time, whether the speed of the box accelerates or not**.
