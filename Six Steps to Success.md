Six Steps to help you realize success:
1. Have an ultimate goal
2. Quit running yourself down
3. Stop thinking of all the reasons you cannot be successful and instead think of all the reasons you can. 
4. Trace your attitudes back to your childhood and try to discover where you first got the idea you couldn’t be a success— if that’s the way you’ve been thinking
5. Change the image you have of your self by writing out a description of the person you would like to be
6. Act the part of the successful person you have decided to become
