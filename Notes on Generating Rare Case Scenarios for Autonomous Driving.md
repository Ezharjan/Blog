Motionalâ€™s Continuous Learning Framework (CLF) is a system that finds those rare edge cases in the large volume of data that we collect every day from our fleet. This holistic framework employs a number of key steps: mining for rare cases, creating training data through automatic and manual data annotation, retraining our machine learning models using that data, and evaluating the updated models at scale.
